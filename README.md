# ART 384LAB Computational Media I: Art Design & Creative Coding

<i>Overview </i> <br>
This course introduces students to creative practices that come into play when we translate human ideas into machine operations. We will use computer languages to generate data flows expressed as images, texts and sounds and signals, locating the potential for artistic expression and action along multiple stages of the creation process. Students will learn to work across  multiple coding contexts, including Processing and Python on cloud compute environments, learn to love the command line interface and make computers do some very strange things


<i>Coding environments</i>
<br>Processing, Python, Julia and Jupyter notebooks
